        <p class="bio">Hello! I am in my fourth year at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and pursuing a degree in Environmental Geography. Along with my degree, I am working towards three Certificates in GIS, Water Resources, and Cartography and Geovisualization. I aim to be involved with Sustainability, Environmental Protection, and Green Energy throughout my career.

            When I'm not in class, much of my free time goes towards Track & Field, practicing and competing primarily as a high jumper. The outdoors is another place I like to spend my free time. Hunting, fishing, and exploring have given me a great appreciation for the environment.</p>
